TITLE: I am a girl (18) that wants to let a guy (18) know that im hurt.

POST: OK so theres this guy I had sex with earlier this year twice and he was really nice to me and everything . But then he rooted and booted me. Fast forward maybe 5 months and he calls me up one night when, drunk, wanting to see me. I saw him at a party the week before so maybe I got in his head again. Either way he rooted and booted me again and hasn't talk to me since and when I tried it was just him and his mates being silly and saying stuff. Like it's pretty much impossible to see him when I want to as he's a player and is always with the boys.

So what I want to know is, next time he calls me up wanting a booty call or whatever I need to know what to say to let him know that he really really hurt me and it hurts to be had sex with and then him not care? Do any guys know a way that will make him actually CARE and get the picture.

TL;DR:
GOLDEN:  had sex with a player, care about him, want to let him no I'm hurt in a way that he will understand
